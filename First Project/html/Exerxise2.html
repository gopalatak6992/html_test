    <header>Header : The Header element</header>
    <main>
        <p>The HTML element represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. <br>It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.
        </p>

            <h2>Usage notes</h2>
            The header element has an identical meaning to the site-wide banner landmark role, unless nested within sectioning content. Then, the header element is not a landmark.<br>
            The header element can define a global site header, described as a banner in the accessibility tree. It usually includes a logo, company name, search feature, and possibly the global navigation or a slogan. It is generally located at the top of the page.
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Historical Usage</h2>
            The header element originally existed at the very beginning of HTML for headings.<br> It is seen in the very first website. At some point, headings became h1 through h6, allowing header to be free to fill a different role.

            <h2>Article Tag</h2>
        <article>The  HTML element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry, a product card, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.

        Several species of salamander inhabit the temperate rainforest of the Pacific Northwest, including the Ensatina, the
        Northwestern Salamander and the Rough-skinned Newt. Most salamanders are nocturnal, and hunt for insects, worms and
        other small creatures.

            The  HTML element is the generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way using CSS (e.g. styling is directly applied to it, or some kind of layout model like Flexbox is applied to its parent element).
